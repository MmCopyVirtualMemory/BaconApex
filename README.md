# BaconToasters-Updated-Cheat
the non updated original version is here: https://github.com/BaconToaster/UC-Apex-Remastered
I am not responsible for any code changes besides one line making it run and the updating of the offsets, everything else was made by BaconToaster/$urge/matchew:

You won't last more than a game with this according to some people in the main discord. I have stopped updating for that reason. If you need the updated game reversals, check UC.
